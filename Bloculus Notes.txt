- Arcade - start on halfway, progress goes down, reaches 0 = game over



Multiplayer:
- Faster paced
- Reverse controls
- Freeze controls
- Speed up other player while slowing down / freezing own tower
- 2 game modes - continuous, race to finish stages
- Show score per level and total score
- Powerups with numbers in, only play effect when you get that combo
- Spawn bricks on other player's tower with number, need to do combos to break
